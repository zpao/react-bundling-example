# React Bundling Example

This is a super simple project what creating a client-side bundle from node might look like.

There are some reports of React being double-bundled when using addons, which should not be the case.

## Usage:

1. Run `npm run bundle` to create your own bundle using browserify.
2. Open index.html.
